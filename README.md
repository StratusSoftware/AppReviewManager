# App Review Manager

This is a Demo Blazor App that consumes a mock 'Google Play' Web API to simulate the management of App Reviews.

## Discussion Points
Please ignore the styling, this isn't a reflection on my design quality. :smiley:

I have tried to show various concepts I have used previously, some concepts are in but not in use, such as FluentValidation. I did want to add the concept of reporting a review to be taken down although I thought I was going too far with this demo (I'm happy to add if required).

API Models/Responses are taken from the real Google Play API with the idea being we would switch out the API URI in appsettings with the addition of auth handling.

I haven't managed to use many components or things like cascading parameters which I would use on a larger project and relied on Radzen for more than I would usually.

Comments are light and I've not been strict with coding standards in regards to naming etc.

Hopefully enough to discuss further :thumbsup:
